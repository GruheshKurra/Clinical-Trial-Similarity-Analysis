Clinical Response Through Maintenance-Week 54 Measured Using the Mayo Score, Clinical response was defined as a decrease from Induction-Week 0 in the Mayo score by greater than or equal to (\\>=) 30 percent and \\>=3 points, with a decrease in the rectal bleeding subscore of \\>= 1 or a rectal bleeding subscore of 0 or 1. The Mayo score is the primary tool for assessing ulcerative colitis activity. The Mayo score consists of 4 subscores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings of endoscopy, and physician's global assessment) which range from 0 to 3.

the induction treatment period:\\n\\n* Stool Frequency subscore = 0 or 1, with at least 1-point decrease from baseline\\n* Rectal Bleeding subscore = 0\\n* Endoscopic subscore = 0 or 1 on modified Mayo Score, with at least 1-point decrease from baseline\\n* No occurrence of UC Flare during the treatment period\\n\\nClinical remission was measured using 3 components of the modified Mayo Score (stool frequency, rectal bleeding and endoscopic subscore), a measure of UC disease activity. These 3 components are each graded from 0 to 3, and are summed together for a composite score, with a higher overall score indicating more severe disease (0 = no disease; 9 = worst disease). The modified Mayo endoscopic subscore excludes friability from an endoscopic subscore of 1., After 10 weeks of induction dosing

The Mayo score comprises of four sub scores: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, endoscopic findings and the Physician's Global Assessment (PhGA). Each sub score is graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating more severe disease. The full Mayo score is the sum of four sub scores, ranging from 0 to 12. Clinical remission is defined as a full Mayo score of 2 points or lower, with no individual subscore exceeding one point. The clinical remission rate is expressed as percentage of participants. The binary endpoint of clinical remission rate (Yes/No) at the EoT visit was modelled with binomial distribution and analyzed via the Bayesian approach with baseline total Mayo score and treatment

at Week 8 - Induction Period, The Mayo score is a tool designed to measure disease activity for ulcerative colitis. The PMS (Mayo score without endoscopy) ranges from 0 (normal or inactive disease) to 9 (severe disease) and is calculated as the sum of 3 sub scores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding and physician's global assessment), each of which ranges from 0 (normal) to 3 (severe disease). A negative change in PMS indicates improvement. Clinical remission was defined as a PMS ≤ 2 and no individual subscore \\> 1., Week 8|Co-Primary Endpoint 2: Percentage of Participants With Clinical Remission Per Full Mayo Score (FMS) at Week 52 in Week 8 Responders Per PMS - Maintenance Period, The FMS ranges from 0 (normal or inactive disease) to 12 (severe disease) and is calculated as the sum of 4 subscores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, endoscopy, and physician's global assessment), each of which ranges from 0 (normal) to 3 (severe disease). The PMS (Mayo score without endoscopy) ranges from 0 (normal or inactive disease) to 9 (severe disease) and is calculated as the sum of 3 subscores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding and physician's global assessment). Negative changes indicate improvement. PMS responders are defined as those with a decrease in PMS ≥ 2 points and ≥ 30% from Baseline.

decrease of \\>=1 point in a modified endoscopic subscore (any friability is scored as 2) or an absolute endoscopy score of \\<=1 without friability. Participants with missing values were handled by observed case approach (the missing data were used as is). The percentage of participants achieving endoscopic improvement was calculated based on the number of participants with observed data., Week 12|Percentage of Participants With Endoscopic Improvement at Week 12 ( Treatment Failure Approach), Endoscopic improvement is defined as a decrease of \\>=1 point in a modified endoscopic subscore (any friability is scored as 2) or an absolute endoscopy score of \\<=1 without friability. Participants with missing values were handled by treatment failure approach (participants who had missing value for any reasons were considered as treatment failures)., Week 12|Percentage of Participants Achieving Geboes Index Remission at Week 12 (Observed Cases), Geboes index is a structured six-grade classification system ordered as follows: 0, structural changes (sub-grade: 0-0.3); 1, chronic inflammatory infiltrate (sub-grade: 1-1.3); 2, lamina propria neutrophils and eosinophils (sub-grade: 2A-2B.3); 3, neutrophils in epithelium (sub-grade: 3-3.3); 4, crypt destruction (sub-grade: 4-4.3); and 5, erosion and ulceration (sub-grade: 5-5.4). The final index ranges from 0 to 5.4, with low score associated with no inflammation or less inflammation and high score associated with severe inflammation or ulceration. Geboes index remission was defined as Geboes index \\< 3 and Grade 3 \\< 3.1 at week 12. Participants with missing values were handled by observed case approach (the missing data were used as is). The percentage of participants achieving Geboes index remission was calculated based on the number of participants with observed data., Week 12|Change From Baseline in Robart's Histology Index at Week 12 (Observed Cases), Robart's histology index is based on the Geboes scores, and the final score is obtained by the summation of four main items (chronic inflammatory infiltrate level, lamina propria neutrophils, neutrophils in the epithelium, and erosion or ulceration), which are classified from 0 (no inflammation) to 3 (severe inflammation or ulceration), yielding a final score that ranges between 0 (no inflammation) and 33 (severe inflammation or ulceration). Participants with missing values were handled by observed case approach (the missing data were used as is)., Week 12|Percentage of Participants With a Clinical Response at Week 12 (Observed Cases), The Mayo score consists of 4 subscores (Endoscopic, stool frequency, rectal bleeding and Physician's global assessment \\[PGA\\]), each graded 0 to 3 with the higher score indicating more severe disease activity. Clinical response is defined with a decrease from baseline of at least 3 points in total Mayo score with at least 30% change, accompanied by at least one-point decrease or absolute score of 0 or 1 in rectal bleeding subscore. Participants with missing values were handled by observed case approach (the missing data were used as is)., Week 12|Percentage of Participants With a Clinical Response at Week 12 (Treatment Failure Approach), The Mayo score consists of 4 subscores (Endoscopic, stool frequency, rectal bleeding and Physician's global assessment \\[PGA\\]), each graded 0 to 3 with the higher score indicating more severe disease activity. Clinical response is defined with a decrease from baseline of at least 3 points in total Mayo score with at least 30% change, accompanied by at least one-point decrease or absolute score of 0 or 1 in rectal bleeding subscore. Participants with missing values were handled by treatment failure approach (participants who had missing value for any reasons were considered as treatment failures)., Week 12|Percentage of Participants With Change From Baseline in Derived Partial Mayo Score of <=2 With no Individual Subscore >1 at Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12 (Observed Cases), The Mayo score is determined by the summation of 4 subscores (Endoscopic, stool frequency, rectal bleeding and Physician's global assessment \\[PGA\\]), each graded 0 (normal) to 3 (worst). Derived partial mayo score is defined as total Mayo score excluding the endoscopic subscore (stool frequency, rectal bleeding and PGA only), ranging from 0 (normal) to 9 (the most severe). The percentages of participants with change from baseline in derived partial Mayo score of \\<=2 with no individual subscore \\>1 at Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12 were calculated for this endpoint. Participants with missing values were handled by observed case approach (the missing data were used as is). Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) was used with fixed effects of treatment, visit and treatment by visit interaction., Baseline, Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12|Serum Concentrations of PF-06687234 20 mg, Samples for serum PF-06687234 concentration were collected approximately 30 minutes prior to dosing. Concentration values below the lower limit of quantification were excluded when calculating the geometric mean (geometric coefficient of variation)., Prior to dosing on Day 1 and at Weeks 1, 3, 7, 11, 12 (168 hours post dose) and 16|Percentage of Participants With the Development of Human Anti-Fusion Antibodies (HAFAs) and Neutralizing Antibodies (NAbs) Against PF-06687234, Plasma samples were analyzed for anti PF-06687234, anti PF-06687234 IL-10 neutralizing antibody (AB) and anti PF-06687234 single chain variable fragment (scFv) neutralizing AB.

The scale ranges from 0 to 144, where lower scores indicate worse performance and higher score indicates better performance. Least Squares (LS) Mean value was controlled for fixed, categorical effects of treatment, visit and treatment-by-visit interaction, pooled investigator, acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) and/or

                                                       Change From Baseline in the 13-item Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog13) Score, The ADAS is a rater administered instrument that was designed to assess the severity of the dysfunction in the cognitive and noncognitive behaviors characteristic of persons with AD. The cognitive subscale of the ADAS consists of 13 items assessing areas of cognitive function most typically impaired in AD: orientation, verbal memory, language, praxis, delayed free recall, digit cancellation. The ADAS--Cog13 scale ranges from 0 to 85. Higher scores indicate greater disease severity. LS Mean value was controlled for fixed, categorical effects of treatment, visit and treatment-by-visit interaction, pooled investigator, AChEI and/or memantine use at baseline, as well as the continuous, fixed covariates of baseline, baseline-by-visit, and age at baseline., Baseline, 76 Weeks|Change From Baseline in the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) Score, CDR-SB is a semi-structured interview of participants and their caregivers. Participant's cognitive status is rated across 6 domains of functioning, including memory, orientation, judgment/problem solving, community affairs, home/hobbies, and personal care. Severity score assigned for each of 6 domains; Total score (SB) ranges from 0 to 18. Higher scores indicate greater disease severity. LS Mean value was controlled for fixed, categorical effects of treatment, visit and treatment-by-visit interaction, pooled investigator, AChEI and/or memantine use at baseline, as well as the continuous, fixed covariates of baseline, baseline-by-visit, and age at baseline., Baseline, 76 Weeks|Change From Baseline in the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) Score, MMSE is a brief screening instrument used to assess cognitive function (orientation, memory, attention, ability to name objects, follow verbal/written commands, write a sentence, and copy figures). Total score ranges from 0 to 30; lower score indicates greater disease severity. LS Mean value was controlled for fixed, categorical effects of treatment, visit and treatment-by-visit interaction, pooled investigator, AChEI and/or memantine use at baseline, as well as the continuous, fixed covariates of baseline, baseline-by-visit, and age at baseline., Baseline, 76 Weeks|Change From Baseline in Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADCS-iADL) Score, The ADCS-ADL is a 23-item inventory developed as a rater-administered questionnaire answered by the participant's caregiver. The ADCS-ADL measures both basic and instrumental activities (instrumental activity items 6a, 7-23) of daily living by participants. The range for the ADCS-iADL is 0-59 with higher scores reflecting better performance. LS Mean value was controlled for fixed, categorical effects of treatment, visit and treatment-by-visit interaction, pooled investigator, AChEI and/or memantine use at baseline, as well as the continuous, fixed covariates of baseline, baseline-by-visit, and age at baseline., Baseline, 76 Weeks|Change From Baseline in Brain Amyloid Plaque Deposition as Measured by Florbetapir F18 Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Scan, Florbetapir PET imaging was used as a quantitative amyloid biomarker. Florbetapir PET scans at baseline and at 76 weeks after the first treatment were used to quantitatively estimate change in amyloid plaques. Quantitative amyloid burden was first formalized as the average Standardized Uptake Value Ratio (SUVR) in six predetermined cortical areas of the brain relative to the cerebellum as a reference region. Larger SUVR reflects the larger cortical amyloid burden relative to cerebellum. SUVR values were further calibrated to a centiloid (CL) scale. The Centiloid scale anchor points are 0 and 100, where 0 represents a high-certainty amyloid negative scan and 100 represents the amount of global amyloid deposition found in a typical AD scan. Least Squares mean change was controlled for fixed, categorical effects of treatment, visit and treatment-by-visit interaction, as well as the continuous, fixed covariates of baseline, baseline-by-visit, and age at baseline., Baseline, 76 Weeks|Change From Baseline in Brain Tau Deposition as Measured by Flortaucipir F18 PET Scan, Flortaucipir PET imaging was used as a quantitative tau biomarker. Flortaucipir PET scans at baseline and at 76 weeks after the first treatment were used to quantitatively estimate change in aggregated tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Quantitative tau burden was formalized using two measures: weighted average Standardized Uptake Value Ratio (MUBADA SUVR) in the brain relative to the cerebellum gray as a reference region and the global tau load (TauL) generated using a TauIQ method. Larger weighted average SUVR reflects the larger cortical tau burden relative to cerebellum gray. The TauIQ method quantifies the spatiotemporal accumulation pattern of tau and larger TauL value reflects the larger global tau level in the brain as determined using a TauIQ mathematical framework. Least Squares mean change was controlled for baseline + age + treatment (Type III sum of squares)., Baseline, 76 Weeks|Change From Baseline in Brain Volume as Measured by Volumetric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (vMRI), MRI scans at baseline and at 76 weeks after the first treatment were used to quantitatively estimate change in brain atrophy. Volumetric MRI (vMRI) parameters were measured in 14 brain regions: bilateral cortical, bilateral entorhinal cortex, bilateral hippocampus, bilateral inferior parietal lobe, bilateral isthmus cingulate, bilateral lateral parietal lobe, bilateral medial temporal lobe, bilateral precuneus, bilateral prefrontal lobe, bilateral superior temporal lobe, bilateral ventricles, bilateral whole brain, bilateral whole temporal lobe, and bilateral white matter.

The modified ADAS-Cog 13 item scale includes all original ADAS-Cog items with the addition of a number cancellation task and a delayed free recall task, for a maximum total score of 85 points, with higher scores indicative of worse cognitive performance. Thus, a negative change from baseline represents improvement in cognition. Items are recorded on an electronic device which will provide the ADAS-Cog 13 total score., Week 104|Change From Baseline in Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living for Mild Cognitive Impairment (ADCS-ADL MCI) Total Score at Week 104, ADCS-ADL MCI is a functional measure based on information provided by the study partner (informant) that describes the performance of participants in several ADLs. It assesses 18 instrumental activities of daily living (higher level daily functions) and one basic daily function (dressing). Total score ranges from 0 to 53 with higher scores indicating less impairment., Week 104|Change From Baseline in Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) Total Scale Index Score at Week 88, The RBANS includes 12 subtests that are divided into 5 RBANS indices: 1-Immediate memory (List learning and story memory); 2-Visuospatial/constructional (figure copy and line orientation); 3-Language (picture naming and semantic fluency); 4-Attention (digit span and coding); 5-Delayed memory (list recall, list recognition, story memory, and figure recall) will be reported. Index scores are expressed as an age-adjusted standard score with a normal mean of 100 and an SD of 15. The sum of Index Scores is the sum of the 5 index scores, and the Sum of Index Scores is converted to an RBANS Total Scale Index Score via a mapping table. RBANS Total Scale Index Score is a norm-based t-score, based on a distribution with a mean of 100 and standard deviation (SD) of 15. Higher scores on each sub measure and index indicate better performance., Baseline, Week 88|Change From Baseline in RBANS Indices at Week 88, Change from baseline in RBANS indices will be assessed.

The CDR is scored 2 ways yielding a global CDR score (CDR GS, derived from an algorithm including categorical scoring of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 3), as well as CDR-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB, the continuous sum of 6 domains, up to a total score of 18, with higher scores representing worse disease state). The Sum of boxes and global score is calculated from the overall CDR., Baseline, Week 104|Change from Baseline in Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) at Week 104, The NPI is a measure of psychobehavioral disturbances, assessing the frequency and severity of disturbances in 12 domains. Frequency for each domain is rated on a 4 point scale (from 1=rarely to 4=very often) and severity on a 3 point scale (from 1=mild to 3=severe), with the score for each domain being the product of the frequency and severity scores, such that each domain is scored from 1 to 12. The NPI total score is the sum of the 12 domain scores, ranging from 0 (best) to 144 (worst)., Baseline, Week 104|Percentage of Participants Progressing From Clinical Dementia Rating- Global Score (CDR-GS) 0 to 0.5 or Higher, 0.5 to 1 or Higher, 1 to 2 or Higher, from Baseline to Post-baseline through Week 104, The CDR is a subjectively rated outcome measure that serves as a global clinical staging instrument that includes 3 cognitive and 3 functional ratings, including: 1) memory, 2) orientation, 3) judgment and problem solving, 4) involvement in community affairs, 5) home and hobbies, and 6) personal care based on the CDR interview. The CDR is scored 2 ways yielding a global CDR score (CDR GS, derived from an algorithm developed by the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri, US, and including categorical scoring of 0= cognitively unimpaired, 0.5= mild cognitive impairment, 1= mild dementia, 2= moderate dementia, and 3= severe dementia), as well as CDR-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB, the continuous sum of 6 domains, up to a total score of 18, with higher scores representing worse disease state)., From Baseline through Week 104|Change From Baseline in Brain tau Burden as Measured by tau PET at Week 104, Change from baseline in brain tau burden, as measured by tau positron emission tomography (PET) will be assessed., Baseline, Week 104|Change From Baseline in Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) concentrations of Total, Free, and Bound p217+tau Fragments at Week 104, Change from baseline in CSF concentrations of total, free, and bound p217+tau (phosphorylated tau) fragments will be assessed., Baseline, Week 104|CSF Concentrations of JNJ-63733657, CSF concentrations of JNJ-63733657 will be assessed., At Weeks 52, 104, 208 (End of Treatment)|Serum Concentrations of JNJ-63733657, Serum concentrations of JNJ-63733657 will be assessed., At Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 36, 52, 76, 104, 128, 156, 180, 208, 232 (End of treatment)|Anti-Drug Antibody to JNJ-63733657, Anti-drug antibody to JNJ-63733657 will be assessed., Up to 245 Weeks (90 days [+-7 days] after last dose of study intervention)|Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs) as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered a medicinal (investigational or non investigational) product.

It is also used in studies of interventions in people with mild cognitive impairment. It is also used for assessing the efficacy of antidementia treatments. The test is administered and scored by a certified rater to assess the cognitive domains of memory, language, orientation and praxis. A higher score is indicative of more severe disease, with 0 (no cognitive deficit) being the lowest score possible and 80 being the highest score and associated with severe cognitive impairment.

Cooperative Study Clinical Global Impression of Change [ADCS CGIC], The ADCS-CGIC focuses on clinicians' observations of change in the subject's cognitive, functional, and behavioral performance since the beginning of a trial. It relies on both direct examination of the subject and interview of informants (e.g. trial partner). global severity at baseline scored from 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill patients); and global change at follow-up scored from 1 (marked improvement) to 7 (marked worsening), where 4 indicates no change., baseline and week 30 (end of study)|Neuropsychiatric Index 12, 12 questions with total score 0-12, with higher score indicating worse disease, baseline and week 30 (end of study)|CDR Global Score, The CDR is a 5-point scale used to characterize 6 domains of cognitive and functional performance applicable to AD and related dementias. Higher score is more severe disease symptoms. The overall CDR Global Score is calculated through the use of an algorithm. 0= normal, 0.5= very mild dementia, 1=mild dementia, 2=moderate dementia, 3=severe dementia, baseline and week 30 (end of study)              COMPLETED            2.0            439.0          1.0              COMPLETED              6.66            0.022                  0                     0          0.995465\n",

The ADCS-ADL measures both basic and instrumental activities of daily living by participants. The range for the ADCS-iADL is 0-59 with higher scores reflecting better performance. LS Mean was determined by MMRM model with factors for treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, AChEI use at baseline, pooled site, and covariates for baseline iADL score, age at baseline, and baseline iADL score-by-visit interaction., Baseline, Week 78|Change From Baseline in Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) Score, FAQ is a 10-item, caregiver-based questionnaire and was administered to the study partner who was asked to rate the participant's ability to perform a variety of activities ranging from writing checks, assembling tax records, shopping, playing games, food preparation, traveling, keeping appointments, traveling out of neighborhood, keeping track of current events and understanding media. FAQ total score was calculated by adding the scores from each of the 10 items. Each activity is rated on a scale from 0 to 3 (Never did and would have difficulty now=1; never did \\[the activity\\] but could do now=0; normal=0; has difficulty but does by self=1; requires assistance=2; Dependent =3). FAQ scale is 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating greater impairment. LS Mean determined by MMRM model with factors for treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, AChEI use at baseline, pooled site, and covariates for baseline FAQ total score, by-visit interaction and age at baseline., Baseline, Week 78|Change From Baseline on the Integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (iADRS) Score, The iADRS is a composite that measures both cognition and function. The iADRS comprises scores form the ADAS- Cog and the ADCS-iADL. The iADRS is calculated as a linear combination of the total scores of the ADAS-Cog13 (score range 0 to 85 with higher scores reflecting worse performance) and the ADCS-iADL (score range from 0-59 with higher scores reflecting better performance). The iADRS score ranges from 0 to 144 with higher scores indicating greater impairment. LS Mean was determined by MMRM with factors for treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, AChEI use at baseline, pooled site, and covariates for baseline iADRS13 total score, age at baseline, and baseline iADRS13 total score-by-visit interaction., Baseline, Week 78|Change From Baseline in the Clinical Dementia Rating - Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) Score, The CDR-SB is a rater administered scale and impairment is scored in each of categories: memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies and personal care. Impairment is scored on a scale in which no dementia = 0, questionable dementia = 0.5, mild dementia = 1, moderate dementia = 2 and severe dementia = 3. The 6 individual category ratings, or \"box scores\", were added together to give the CDR-Sum of Boxes which ranges from 0-18, with higher scores indicating greater impairment. LS Mean was determined by MMRM methodology with factors for treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, AChEI use at baseline, pooled site, and covariates for baseline CDR-SB score, age at baseline, and baseline CDR-SB score-by-visit interaction., Baseline, Week 78|Time to Progression as Measured by Loss of Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) Global Score Stage, The CDR global score is a composite score calculated using the Washington University CDR-assignment algorithm applied to the 6 individual domain box scores (Morris 1993). The memory domain is considered the primary category that drives the CDR global outcome, and all other domains are secondary. The CDR global score ranges from 0 to 3 (0 = no dementia, 0.5 = questionable dementia, 1 = mild dementia, 2 = moderate dementia, 3 = severe dementia)., From Loss of 1 Global Stage through Week 78|Change From Baseline in Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) Score, The NPI is a questionnaire administered to caregivers that quantifies behavioral changes. Each of the 12 behavioral domains the caregiver reports as present are scored for Frequency, scale: 1 (Occasionally) to 4 (Very Frequently), and Severity, scale: 1 (Mild) to 3 (Severe). If the domain is reported by the caregiver as 'Not Affected,' that domain is scored as 0. The individual domain scores are calculated by multiplying the frequency times the severity for each domain. NPI Total Score is calculated by adding the individual domain scores together for all 12 domains, with a scores range from 0 to 144, with higher scores indicating a greater severity of neuropsychiatric disturbance. LS Mean was determined by MMRM methodology with factors for treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, AChEI use at baseline, pooled site, and covariates for baseline NPI score, age at baseline, and baseline NPI score-by-visit interaction., Baseline, Week 78|Change From Baseline on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), The MMSE is an instrument used to assess a participant's global cognitive function. The MMSE assesses orientation to time and place, immediate and delayed recall of words, attention and calculation, language (naming, comprehension and repetition), and spatial ability (copying a figure). The range for MMSE total Score is 0 to 30, with a higher score indicating better cognitive performance. LS Mean was determined by MMRM methodology with factors for treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, AChEI use at baseline, pooled site, and covariates for baseline MMSE total score, age at baseline, and baseline MMSE total score-by-visit interaction., Baseline, Week 78|Percent Change From Baseline in Concentration of Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Biomarker Amyloid Beta (Aβ)1-42, Concentration of the peptide Aβ 1-42 in plasma measured by validated immunoassay. LS Mean was determined by Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with last observation carried forward (LOCF), terms for treatment, baseline biomarker and age at baseline., Baseline, Week 71|Percent Change From Baseline in Concentration of CSF Biomarker Aβ1-40, Concentration of the peptide Aβ 1-40 in plasma measured by immunoassay. LS Mean was determined by ANCOVA with LOCF (last observation carried forward), terms for treatment, baseline biomarker and age at baseline., Baseline, Week 71|Change From Baseline in CSF Biomarker Total Tau, Cerebrospinal fluid samples were collected for analysis of concentration total tau. LS Mean was determined by ANCOVA with LOCF and with factors for treatment, baseline biomarker and age at baseline., Baseline, Week 71|Change From Baseline in CSF Biomarker Phosphorylated Tau, Cerebrospinal fluid samples are collected for analysis of concentration of phosphorylated tau. LS Mean was determined by ANCOVA with LOCF and with factors for treatment, baseline biomarker and age at baseline., Baseline, Week 71|Change From Baseline in Brain Amyloid Burden Using Florbetapir Amyloid Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Scan, Amyloid deposition in the brain is one of the defining neuropathologic findings of Alzheimer's disease. Florbetapir exhibits high affinity specific binding to amyloid plaques. The change from baseline was measured as average standard uptake value ratio (SUVr) in prespecified regions of interest (ROI) assessed by florbetapir amyloid PET imaging in a subset of participants. The Centiloid scale standardizes quantitative brain amyloid PET results to allow cross-tracer and cross-methodology comparisons. The Centiloid scale anchor points are 0 and 100, where 0 represents a high-certainty amyloid negative scan and 100 represents the amount of global amyloid deposition found in a typical AD scans. Florbetapir SUVr was converted to the Centiloid scale using the following conversion: Florbetapir Centiloids = 183 x SUVr - 177. LS Mean was determined by using ANCOVA methodology with terms for treatment, baseline biomarker and age at baseline., Baseline, Week 78|Change From Baseline in Regional Cerebral Blood Flow (rCBF) Using Florbetapir Perfusion Scan, Florbetapir perfusion evaluated the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) as a biomarker of brain function and was performed at the same time as the amyloid florbetapir PET. Cerebral perfusion, especially in temporal and parietal areas, is reduced in AD and this pattern of hypoperfusion closely mirrors the hypometabolism pattern observed using FDG PET. Annualized change is derived as change at LOCF divided by (LOCF date - baseline date) multiplied by 365. LS Mean was determined by ANCOVA with LOCF (last observation carried forward) and with factors for treatment, baseline biomarker and age at baseline., Baseline, Week 78|Change From Baseline in Whole Brain Volume, Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to evaluate the effect of lanabecestat on brain atrophy/whole brain volumes. Annualized change is derived as change at LOCF divided by (LOCF date - baseline date) multiplied by 365. LS Mean was determined by ANCOVA with LOCF and with factors for treatment, baseline volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (vMRI), intracranial volume and age at baseline., Baseline, Week 78|Population Pharmacokinetics (PK): Apparent Oral Clearance of Lanabecestat, The apparent oral clearance of lanabecestat was estimated using a population approach.

The scale consists of 40 questions assessing basic and instumental ADLs. A total score is obtained by adding the rating for each question and converting this total score out of 100. The items rated N/A are not considered for the total score. Higher scores represent less disability in activities of daily living (ADL) while lower scores indicate more dysfunction., Baseline to 16 Weeks              COMPLETED                           171.0          1.0              COMPLETED              1.48            0.111                  0                     0          0.994497\n",

  Change From Baseline to Last Visit of Double-Blind Treatment Period on the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), The Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) is a scale used to quantify the severity of symptoms of dementia. The CDR-SB is obtained through interviews of patients and informants, and disease severity is rated in 6 domains of functioning: memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care. Each domain is rated on a 5-point scale of functioning as follows: 0, no impairment; 0.5, questionable impairment; 1, mild impairment; 2, moderate impairment; and 3, severe impairment (personal care is scored on a 4-point scale without a 0.5 rating available). The CDR-SB score is obtained by summing each of the domain box scores, with scores ranging from 0 to 18, with the higher values representing more severe impairment., Baseline to Week 49 for Cohorts 1 and 2, and Baseline to Week 61 for Cohort 2|Change From Baseline to Last Visit of Double-Blind Treatment Period on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) is a brief clinical cognitive examination commonly used to screen for dementia and other cognitive deficits that has a total score of 0-30.

Quantitative amyloid burden was first formalized as the average Standardized Uptake Value Ratio (SUVR) in six predetermined cortical brain regions relative to the cerebellum as a reference region. Larger SUVR reflects the larger cortical amyloid burden relative to cerebellum. SUVR values were further calibrated to a centiloid (CL) scale. The Centiloid scale anchor points are 0 and 100, where 0 represents a high-certainty amyloid negative scan and 100 represents the amount of global amyloid deposition found in a typical AD scan. LS Mean value was adjusted for treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, and covariates for baseline score, baseline score-by-visit interaction, baseline tau category, and age at baseline., Baseline, Week 76|Change From Baseline in Brain Tau Deposition as Measured by Flortaucipir F18 PET Scan, Flortaucipir PET imaging was used as a quantitative tau biomarker. Tau PET scans at baseline and at 76 weeks after the first treatment were used to quantitatively estimate change in aggregated tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Quantitative tau burden was formalized using Standardized Uptake Value Ratio (SUVR) in frontal lobe relative to the cerebellum gray as a reference region. Larger SUVR reflects larger tau burden in the frontal lobe relative to cerebellum gray. LS Mean value was adjusted for baseline score, screening tau category, age and treatment (Type III sum of squares)., Baseline, Week 76|Change From Baseline in Brain Volume as Measured by Volumetric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (vMRI), MRI scans at baseline and at 76 weeks after the first treatment were used to quantitatively estimate change in brain volume.

Alzheimer´s Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living Inventory Instrumental Items (ADCS-iADL), The ADCS-ADL is a 23-item inventory developed as a rater-administered questionnaire answered by the participant's caregiver. The ADCS-ADL measures both basic and instrumental activities of daily living by participants. The range for the ADCS-iADL is 0-59 with higher scores reflecting better performance. LS Mean was determined by MMRM with factors for treatment, visit, treatment\\*visit, baseline efficacy score, baseline efficacy score-by-visit interaction, disease status at baseline, APOE4 status, AChEI use at baseline, age at baseline, and pooled country., AZES Baseline through AZFD Week 26|Change From Baseline on the Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) Score, FAQ is a 10-item, caregiver-questionnaire and was administered to the study partner and asked to rate the participant's ability to perform a variety of activities ranging from writing checks, assembling tax records, shopping, playing games, food preparation, traveling, keeping appointments, traveling out of neighborhood, keeping track of current events and understanding media. FAQ total score was calculated by adding the scores from each of the 10 items. Each activity is rated on a scale from 0 to 3 (Never did and would have difficulty now =1; Never did but could do now =0; Normal =0; Has difficulty but does by self =1; Requires assistance =2; Dependent =3). FAQ scale is 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating greater impairment. LS Mean was determined by MMRM with factors for treatment, visit, treatment\\*visit, baseline efficacy score, baseline efficacy score-by-visit interaction, disease status at baseline, APOE4 status, AChEI use at baseline, age at baseline, and pooled country., AZES Baseline through AZFD Week 26|Change From Baseline on the Integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (iADRS) Score, The iADRS is a composite that measures both cognition and function. The iADRS comprises scores form the ADAS- Cog and the ADCS-iADL. The iADRS is calculated as a linear combination of the total scores of the ADAS-Cog13 (score range 0 to 85 with higher scores reflecting worse performance) and the ADCS-iADL (score range from 0-59 with higher scores reflecting better performance). The iADRS score ranges from 0 to 144 with higher scores indicating greater impairment. LS Mean was determined by MMRM with factors for treatment, visit, treatment\\*visit, baseline efficacy score, baseline efficacy score-by-visit interaction, disease status at baseline, APOE4 status, AChEI use at baseline, age at baseline, and pooled country., AZES Baseline through AZFD Week 26|Change From Baseline on the Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE), The MMSE is an instrument used to assess a participant's cognitive function. The MMSE assesses orientation to time and place, immediate and delayed recall of words, attention and calculation, language (naming, comprehension and repetition), and spatial ability (copying a figure). The range for MMSE total Score is 0 to 30, with a higher score indicating better cognitive performance. LS Mean was determined by MMRM methodology with factors for treatment, visit, treatment\\*visit, baseline efficacy score, baseline efficacy score-by-visit interaction, disease status at baseline, APOE4 status, AChEI use at baseline, age at baseline, and pooled country., AZES Baseline through AZFD Week 26|Change From Baseline Analysis on the ADAS-Cog13, ADAS-cog13 (13-item ADAS cog) is a psychometric instrument that evaluates word recall, ability to follow commands, constructional praxis, naming, ideational praxis, orientation, word recognition, memory, comprehension of spoken language, word-finding, and language ability, with a measure of delayed word recall and concentration/ distractibility. The total score of the 13-item scale ranges from 0 to 85, with an increase in score indicating cognitive worsening. Least Squares (LS) mean was determined by mixed-model repeated measures (MMRM) model with factors for treatment, visit, treatment\\*visit, baseline efficacy score, baseline efficacy score-by-visit interaction, disease status at baseline, APOE4 status, AChEI use at baseline, age at baseline, and pooled country., AZES Baseline through AZFD Week 52             TERMINATED            1.0            421.0          1.0             TERMINATED              2.73            0.100                  0                     0          0.994126\n",
