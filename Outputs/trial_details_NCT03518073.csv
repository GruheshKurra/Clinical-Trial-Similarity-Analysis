63735,81021,NCT03367403,A Study of LY3002813 in Participants With Early Symptomatic Alzheimer's Disease (TRAILBLAZER-ALZ),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03367403,,COMPLETED,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of LY3002813 in early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease.",YES,Alzheimer Disease,DRUG: Donanemab|DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: LY3202626,"Change From Baseline in the Integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (iADRS) Score, Integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale is used to assess whether donanemab slows down the cognitive and functional decline associated with AD compared with placebo. iADRS is a simple linear combination of 13-item alzheimer's disease assessment scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog13) and the Alzheimer's disease cooperative study-instrumental activities of daily living scale (ADCS-iADL). The scale ranges from 0 to 144, where lower scores indicate worse performance and higher score indicates better performance. Least Squares (LS) Mean value was controlled for fixed, categorical effects of treatment, visit and treatment-by-visit interaction, pooled investigator, acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) and/or memantine use at baseline, as well as the continuous, fixed covariates of baseline, baseline-by-visit, and age at baseline., Baseline, 76 Weeks","Change From Baseline in the 13-item Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog13) Score, The ADAS is a rater administered instrument that was designed to assess the severity of the dysfunction in the cognitive and noncognitive behaviors characteristic of persons with AD. The cognitive subscale of the ADAS consists of 13 items assessing areas of cognitive function most typically impaired in AD: orientation, verbal memory, language, praxis, delayed free recall, digit cancellation. The ADAS--Cog13 scale ranges from 0 to 85. Higher scores indicate greater disease severity. LS Mean value was controlled for fixed, categorical effects of treatment, visit and treatment-by-visit interaction, pooled investigator, AChEI and/or memantine use at baseline, as well as the continuous, fixed covariates of baseline, baseline-by-visit, and age at baseline., Baseline, 76 Weeks|Change From Baseline in the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) Score, CDR-SB is a semi-structured interview of participants and their caregivers. Participant's cognitive status is rated across 6 domains of functioning, including memory, orientation, judgment/problem solving, community affairs, home/hobbies, and personal care. Severity score assigned for each of 6 domains; Total score (SB) ranges from 0 to 18. Higher scores indicate greater disease severity. LS Mean value was controlled for fixed, categorical effects of treatment, visit and treatment-by-visit interaction, pooled investigator, AChEI and/or memantine use at baseline, as well as the continuous, fixed covariates of baseline, baseline-by-visit, and age at baseline., Baseline, 76 Weeks|Change From Baseline in the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) Score, MMSE is a brief screening instrument used to assess cognitive function (orientation, memory, attention, ability to name objects, follow verbal/written commands, write a sentence, and copy figures). Total score ranges from 0 to 30; lower score indicates greater disease severity. LS Mean value was controlled for fixed, categorical effects of treatment, visit and treatment-by-visit interaction, pooled investigator, AChEI and/or memantine use at baseline, as well as the continuous, fixed covariates of baseline, baseline-by-visit, and age at baseline., Baseline, 76 Weeks|Change From Baseline in Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADCS-iADL) Score, The ADCS-ADL is a 23-item inventory developed as a rater-administered questionnaire answered by the participant's caregiver. The ADCS-ADL measures both basic and instrumental activities (instrumental activity items 6a, 7-23) of daily living by participants. The range for the ADCS-iADL is 0-59 with higher scores reflecting better performance. LS Mean value was controlled for fixed, categorical effects of treatment, visit and treatment-by-visit interaction, pooled investigator, AChEI and/or memantine use at baseline, as well as the continuous, fixed covariates of baseline, baseline-by-visit, and age at baseline., Baseline, 76 Weeks|Change From Baseline in Brain Amyloid Plaque Deposition as Measured by Florbetapir F18 Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Scan, Florbetapir PET imaging was used as a quantitative amyloid biomarker. Florbetapir PET scans at baseline and at 76 weeks after the first treatment were used to quantitatively estimate change in amyloid plaques. Quantitative amyloid burden was first formalized as the average Standardized Uptake Value Ratio (SUVR) in six predetermined cortical areas of the brain relative to the cerebellum as a reference region. Larger SUVR reflects the larger cortical amyloid burden relative to cerebellum. SUVR values were further calibrated to a centiloid (CL) scale. The Centiloid scale anchor points are 0 and 100, where 0 represents a high-certainty amyloid negative scan and 100 represents the amount of global amyloid deposition found in a typical AD scan. Least Squares mean change was controlled for fixed, categorical effects of treatment, visit and treatment-by-visit interaction, as well as the continuous, fixed covariates of baseline, baseline-by-visit, and age at baseline., Baseline, 76 Weeks|Change From Baseline in Brain Tau Deposition as Measured by Flortaucipir F18 PET Scan, Flortaucipir PET imaging was used as a quantitative tau biomarker. Flortaucipir PET scans at baseline and at 76 weeks after the first treatment were used to quantitatively estimate change in aggregated tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Quantitative tau burden was formalized using two measures: weighted average Standardized Uptake Value Ratio (MUBADA SUVR) in the brain relative to the cerebellum gray as a reference region and the global tau load (TauL) generated using a TauIQ method. Larger weighted average SUVR reflects the larger cortical tau burden relative to cerebellum gray. The TauIQ method quantifies the spatiotemporal accumulation pattern of tau and larger TauL value reflects the larger global tau level in the brain as determined using a TauIQ mathematical framework. Least Squares mean change was controlled for baseline + age + treatment (Type III sum of squares)., Baseline, 76 Weeks|Change From Baseline in Brain Volume as Measured by Volumetric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (vMRI), MRI scans at baseline and at 76 weeks after the first treatment were used to quantitatively estimate change in brain atrophy. Volumetric MRI (vMRI) parameters were measured in 14 brain regions: bilateral cortical, bilateral entorhinal cortex, bilateral hippocampus, bilateral inferior parietal lobe, bilateral isthmus cingulate, bilateral lateral parietal lobe, bilateral medial temporal lobe, bilateral precuneus, bilateral prefrontal lobe, bilateral superior temporal lobe, bilateral ventricles, bilateral whole brain, bilateral whole temporal lobe, and bilateral white matter. The atrophy was assessed by tensor-based morphometry, which captures volume changes within the deformation map.

The total score of the 13-item scale ranges from 0 to 85, with an increase in score indicating cognitive worsening. Least Squares (LS) mean was determined by mixed-model repeated measures (MMRM) model with factors for treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, acetylcholinesterase Inhibitor (AChEI) use at baseline, pooled site, and covariates for baseline ADAS-Cog13 total score, age at baseline, and baseline ADAS-Cog13 total score-by-visit interaction., Baseline, Week 78","Change From Baseline in Alzheimer´s Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living Inventory Instrumental Items Score (ADCS-iADL), The ADCS-ADL is a 23-item inventory developed as a rater-administered questionnaire answered by the participant's caregiver. The ADCS-ADL measures both basic and instrumental activities of daily living by participants. The range for the ADCS-iADL is 0-59 with higher scores reflecting better performance. LS Mean was determined by MMRM model with factors for treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, AChEI use at baseline, pooled site, and covariates for baseline iADL score, age at baseline, and baseline iADL score-by-visit interaction., Baseline, Week 78|Change From Baseline in Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) Score, FAQ is a 10-item, caregiver-based questionnaire and was administered to the study partner who was asked to rate the participant's ability to perform a variety of activities ranging from writing checks, assembling tax records, shopping, playing games, food preparation, traveling, keeping appointments, traveling out of neighborhood, keeping track of current events and understanding media. FAQ total score was calculated by adding the scores from each of the 10 items. Each activity is rated on a scale from 0 to 3 (Never did and would have difficulty now=1; never did \[the activity\] but could do now=0; normal=0; has difficulty but does by self=1; requires assistance=2; Dependent =3).

The memory domain is considered the primary category that drives the CDR global outcome, and all other domains are secondary. The CDR global score ranges from 0 to 3 (0 = no dementia, 0.5 = questionable dementia, 1 = mild dementia, 2 = moderate dementia, 3 = severe dementia)., From Loss of 1 Global Stage through Week 78|Change From Baseline in Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) Score, The NPI is a questionnaire administered to caregivers that quantifies behavioral changes. Each of the 12 behavioral domains the caregiver reports as present are scored for Frequency, scale: 1 (Occasionally) to 4 (Very Frequently), and Severity, scale: 1 (Mild) to 3 (Severe). If the domain is reported by the caregiver as 'Not Affected,' that domain is scored as 0. The individual domain scores are calculated by multiplying the frequency times the severity for each domain. NPI Total Score is calculated by adding the individual domain scores together for all 12 domains, with a scores range from 0 to 144, with higher scores indicating a greater severity of neuropsychiatric disturbance. LS Mean was determined by MMRM methodology with factors for treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, AChEI use at baseline, pooled site, and covariates for baseline NPI score, age at baseline, and baseline NPI score-by-visit interaction., Baseline, Week 78|Change From Baseline on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), The MMSE is an instrument used to assess a participant's global cognitive function. The MMSE assesses orientation to time and place, immediate and delayed recall of words, attention and calculation, language (naming, comprehension and repetition), and spatial ability (copying a figure). The range for MMSE total Score is 0 to 30, with a higher score indicating better cognitive performance.

LS Mean was determined by ANCOVA with LOCF and with factors for treatment, baseline biomarker and age at baseline., Baseline, Week 71|Change From Baseline in Brain Amyloid Burden Using Florbetapir Amyloid Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Scan, Amyloid deposition in the brain is one of the defining neuropathologic findings of Alzheimer's disease. Florbetapir exhibits high affinity specific binding to amyloid plaques. The change from baseline was measured as average standard uptake value ratio (SUVr) in prespecified regions of interest (ROI) assessed by florbetapir amyloid PET imaging in a subset of participants. The Centiloid scale standardizes quantitative brain amyloid PET results to allow cross-tracer and cross-methodology comparisons. The Centiloid scale anchor points are 0 and 100, where 0 represents a high-certainty amyloid negative scan and 100 represents the amount of global amyloid deposition found in a typical AD scans. Florbetapir SUVr was converted to the Centiloid scale using the following conversion: Florbetapir Centiloids = 183 x SUVr - 177. LS Mean was determined by using ANCOVA methodology with terms for treatment, baseline biomarker and age at baseline., Baseline, Week 78|Change From Baseline in Regional Cerebral Blood Flow (rCBF) Using Florbetapir Perfusion Scan, Florbetapir perfusion evaluated the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) as a biomarker of brain function and was performed at the same time as the amyloid florbetapir PET. Cerebral perfusion, especially in temporal and parietal areas, is reduced in AD and this pattern of hypoperfusion closely mirrors the hypometabolism pattern observed using FDG PET. Annualized change is derived as change at LOCF divided by (LOCF date - baseline date) multiplied by 365. LS Mean was determined by ANCOVA with LOCF (last observation carried forward) and with factors for treatment, baseline biomarker and age at baseline., Baseline, Week 78|Change From Baseline in Whole Brain Volume, Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to evaluate the effect of lanabecestat on brain atrophy/whole brain volumes.

62075,78930,NCT00594568,Effect of LY450139 on the Long Term Progression of Alzheimer's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00594568,,COMPLETED,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a fatal degenerative disease of the brain for which there is no cure. AD causes brain cells to die. AD is thought to be caused by an excess of beta-amyloid (β-amyloid), a sticky protein in the brain that forms amyloid plaques. At autopsy, AD patients are required to have these amyloid plaques in the brain in order to have a definitive diagnosis of AD. Inhibiting the enzyme gamma-secretase (γ-secretase) lowers the production of β-amyloid. Semagacestat (LY450139) is a functional γ-secretase inhibitor and was shown to lower β-amyloid in blood and spinal fluid in humans tested thus far and in blood, spinal fluid, and brain in animals tested thus far. This study used several different tests to measure the effect of semagacestat on both β-amyloid and amyloid plaques for some participants. The build-up of amyloid plaques was measured by a brain scan that takes a picture of amyloid plaques in the brain. Other tests measured the overall function of the brain and brain size in some participants. In this trial, participants who initially received placebo (inactive sugar pill) were, at a certain point in the study, switched over to active drug, semagacestat. In other words, all participants could eventually receive active drug. Participation could last approximately 2 years. Participants taking approved AD medications were permitted to participate in this study and continue taking these medications during the study. All participants who completed this study had the option to continue receiving semagacestat by participating in an open-label study.

Preliminary results from this study (H6L-MC-LFAN \[LFAN\]) and another similar study (H6L-MC-LFBC \[LFBC; NCT00762411\]) showed semagacestat did not slow disease progression and was associated with worsening of clinical measures of cognition and the ability to perform activities of daily living. Study drug was stopped in all studies. Studies LFAN, LFBC, and open-label H6L-MC-LFBF (LFBF; NCT01035138) were amended to continue collecting safety data, including cognitive scores, for at least 7 months. The Clinical Trial Registry (CTR) will reflect results of analyses from the original LFAN protocol in addition to those from the amended LFAN protocol.",YES,Alzheimer's Disease,DRUG: LY450139|DRUG: Placebo,"Change From Baseline in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog11) Score at 76 Weeks, ADAS-Cog11 was used as a primary efficacy measure.

The total score of the 13-item scale ranges from 0 to 85, with an increase in score indicating cognitive worsening. Least Squares (LS) mean was determined by mixed-model repeated measures (MMRM) model with factors for treatment, visit, treatment\*visit, baseline efficacy score, baseline efficacy score-by-visit interaction, disease status at baseline, apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) status, acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) use at baseline, age at baseline, and pooled country., AZES Baseline through AZFD Week 26","Change From Baseline Analysis on the Alzheimer´s Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living Inventory Instrumental Items (ADCS-iADL), The ADCS-ADL is a 23-item inventory developed as a rater-administered questionnaire answered by the participant's caregiver. The ADCS-ADL measures both basic and instrumental activities of daily living by participants. The range for the ADCS-iADL is 0-59 with higher scores reflecting better performance.

FAQ total score was calculated by adding the scores from each of the 10 items. Each activity is rated on a scale from 0 to 3 (Never did and would have difficulty now =1; Never did but could do now =0; Normal =0; Has difficulty but does by self =1; Requires assistance =2; Dependent =3). FAQ scale is 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating greater impairment.

The iADRS comprises scores form the ADAS- Cog and the ADCS-iADL. The iADRS is calculated as a linear combination of the total scores of the ADAS-Cog13 (score range 0 to 85 with higher scores reflecting worse performance) and the ADCS-iADL (score range from 0-59 with higher scores reflecting better performance). The iADRS score ranges from 0 to 144 with higher scores indicating greater impairment.
